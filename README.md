# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.

## Deployment

The project has been hosted at [https://job-listing-sandy-zeta.vercel.app/](https://job-listing-sandy-zeta.vercel.app/) using Vercel.
I chose [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) to host my site as Vercel provides the developer experience and infrastructure to build, scale, and secure a faster, more personalized web. Easy. Building and deploying should be as easy as a single tap. 

Vercel provides easy deployment for static sites and serverless functions as well as sets up CI/CD pipelines which is extremely easy and useful.

## Library Used

The project uses [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) for different components such as Form Inputs, Layouts and Lists. Ant Design is a popular React UI library that provides a collection of high-quality components to help you create interactive user interfaces. It's like a treasure box full of UI elements and development tools that can save hundreds of hours of design work. Ant Design components are easy to use and are responsive too!

## Problems Faced

I barely faced any problems in the creation of this website. I did face a few minor issues here and there like customized Navbar and making it responsive and others. But none of them was too difficult to be resolved. I had fun creating this project.
